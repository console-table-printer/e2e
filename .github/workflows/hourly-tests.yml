# =======================================================================
#
# This workflow runs tests for the console-table-printer and simple-wcswidth 
# packages on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x, 22.x, 24.x).
#
# It performs:
# - Unit tests on all supported Node.js versions
# - E2E tests for the website using Playwright
#
# The workflow runs:
# - Hourly (via cron)
# - On push to main branch
# - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# Test results are uploaded as artifacts and stored for 7 days.
