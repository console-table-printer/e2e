# =======================================================================
# Node.js 14 Compatibility Tests Workflow
# =======================================================================
#
# This workflow specifically tests the compatibility of console-table-printer 
# and simple-wcswidth packages with Node.js 14.x.
#
# Since Jest 30.x is not compatible with Node.js 14.x, this workflow:
# 1. Removes Jest 30.x
# 2. Installs Jest 29.x which is compatible with Node.js 14
# 3. Runs the unit tests
#
# This ensures that users on Node.js 14.x can still use these libraries
# even though the latest testing tools may not support this version.
#
# The workflow runs:
# - Daily at 00:00 UTC
# - On push to main branch
# - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# Test results are uploaded as artifacts and stored for 7 days.
